# Blackboard improvements

This script improves the Blackboard functionality for Instructors and TAs
at Aarhus University by adding the following features:

* "Find users in groups" -- fast, flexible searching for students
* Useful window titles -- instead of just "Blackboard Learn"

More features will be added when I figure out that I need them.

## Installing

First, install the Greasemonkey add-on for Firefox.

The stable version of this Greasemonkey script for Blackboard may be installed
by following the link:

https://github.com/Mortal/bbdyn/raw/stable/bbdyn.user.js

By default, Greasemonkey will periodically auto-update the script from the URL
above.
