# Blackboard improvements

This script improves the Blackboard functionality for Instructors and TAs
at Aarhus University by adding the **Find users in groups** feature,
enabling fast, flexible searching for students in the course.

On this page, the **Export student list** link allows you to download a CSV
file with all students in the course along with their AU ID and groups.
This file can be imported into the Grade Centre to add a column with the group
of each student.

More features will be added when I figure out that I need them.

## Installing

First, install the Greasemonkey add-on for Firefox.

The stable version of this Greasemonkey script for Blackboard may be installed
by following the link:

https://github.com/Mortal/bbdyn/raw/stable/bbdyn.user.js

By default, Greasemonkey will periodically auto-update the script from the URL
above.
